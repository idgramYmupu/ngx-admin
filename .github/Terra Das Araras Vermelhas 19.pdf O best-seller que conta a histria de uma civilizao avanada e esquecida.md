The author of Terra das Araras Vermelhas, Roger Feraudy, was born in 1933 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He studied engineering and journalism, and became involved in the spiritualist movement. He wrote several books on topics such as reincarnation, karma, and mediumship. He also founded the Brazilian Association of Spiritualist Writers and Journalists.
 
Feraudy was inspired to write Terra das Araras Vermelhas after reading a newspaper article about a mysterious tribe that lived in isolation in the Amazon rainforest. He decided to embark on an expedition to find them and learn from their wisdom. He was accompanied by a friend, a photographer, and a guide. They traveled by plane, boat, and foot for several weeks, facing many dangers and difficulties along the way.
 
When they finally reached the tribe, they were welcomed by the chief, who spoke Portuguese and recognized Feraudy as a reincarnated spirit of one of their ancestors. The chief invited Feraudy to stay with them and share their secrets. Feraudy accepted the invitation and spent 19 days living among the tribe, participating in their rituals, ceremonies, and daily activities. He learned about their history, culture, religion, and philosophy. He also experienced visions, dreams, and revelations that changed his life.
 
Terra das Araras Vermelhas is not only a fascinating account of Feraudy's adventure, but also a testimony of his spiritual transformation. He claims that his encounter with the tribe helped him to understand the true meaning of existence and to overcome his fears and doubts. He also expresses his admiration and respect for the tribe's harmony with nature and their respect for life. He urges his readers to follow their example and to seek their own inner truth.
