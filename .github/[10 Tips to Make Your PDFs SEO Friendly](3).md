1. Open the folder that contains the game's setup.exe file.
2. Right-click on the setup.exe file and select Run as administrator.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the game.

## Method 2: Run the Game's Installer in Compatibility Mode
 
Another possible solution is to run the game's installer in compatibility mode. This will make the installer run as if it was on an older version of Windows, which might be more compatible with some games. This method is more likely to work for older games that were released before Windows 10. To run the game's installer in compatibility mode, follow these steps:

1. Open the folder that contains the game's setup.exe file.
2. Right-click on the setup.exe file and select Properties.
3. Select Compatibility along the top of the properties window.
4. Select Run this program in compatibility mode for and choose Windows 7 from the drop-down menu. If your game predates Windows 7, you can also try selecting Vista or XP.
5. Select Run this program as an administrator.
6. Click Apply and OK to save the changes.
7. Run the setup.exe file and install the game.

## Method 3: Set the Game's Setup Wizard at High Priority
 
Setting the game's setup wizard at high priority will increase the system resources allocated to its process. This might help speed up the extraction of archive files and prevent errors. To set the game's setup wizard at high priority, follow these steps:

1. Run the game's setup.exe file and wait for it to start extracting files.
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager.
3. Select Details along the top of Task Manager.
4. Right-click on setup.exe and select Set priority > High.
5. Close Task Manager and wait for the installation to finish.

## Method 4: Run System File and Image Scans
 
Sometimes, system file corruption can cause errors when installing games on Windows. To fix this issue, you can run a System File Checker (SFC) scan and a Deployment Image Servicing Management (DISM) scan. These tools will scan your system for corrupted or missing files and repair them automatically. To run these scans, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select Command Prompt (Admin).
2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete.
3. Type dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth and press Enter. Wait for the scan to complete.
4. Restart your computer and try installing your game again.
